      Customer education, also known as customer training, is a process that
      helps companies educate and support their customers to enhance their
      experience and increase loyalty. It involves providing resources and
      knowledge to customers to help them effectively use and benefit from a
      product or service. The main goal of customer education is to show
      customers the value of a product or service quickly and continuously over
      time.
